	<p class="content">Stache and Belle is about love. Our pets give us what they can and they don't even ask us to return it, but we always do. A custom pet bed is only a small way we can return that attention and a sleeping pet is probably the cuteset thing you've ever seen, so let's make that happen.</p>

	<h2>& for the ones still waiting</h2>

	<p>While we have the love of our lives curled up next to us right now, there are plenty of those loves that are still looking for their companion. Shelters across the country are doing what they can to provide the connection point, but it's still not a great place to wait. Every purchase provides a bed to a shelter pet still waiting for love.</p>
